## GraphQL is a query language and runtime for APIs that allows you to request exactly the data you need and nothing more. It was developed by Facebook and is used to make interacting with APIs more efficient and flexible compared to traditional methods like REST.

# Key Features of GraphQL:

1. **Precise Data Fetching**: Clients can request exactly the fields they need, so there's no over-fetching (getting too much data) or under-fetching (getting too little data). For example, you can ask for just the name and email of a user, instead of receiving all the userâ€™s data.

2. **Single Endpoint**: Unlike REST, where different endpoints provide different types of data (e.g., /users, /posts), GraphQL operates through a single endpoint. All the queries or requests for different types of data are handled at that same endpoint.

3. **Strongly Typed Schema**: GraphQL uses a schema to define the structure of the API, specifying the types of data that can be requested and returned. This ensures that queries are validated and predictable, reducing errors.

4. **Real-Time Data (Subscriptions)**: GraphQL supports subscriptions, which allow you to receive real-time updates when the data changes (e.g., live chat or notifications).

5. **Combines Queries**: With GraphQL, you can combine multiple related queries into a single request. For instance, you can fetch both user data and their related posts in one query.

6. **Version-Free**: Since clients can specify exactly the fields they need, there's no need for versioning the API as it evolves.
