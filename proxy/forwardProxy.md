## Forward Proxy

# A forward proxy handles traffic on behalf of the client and is used to communicate with external servers.

A forward proxy is a server that sits between a client and external servers, forwarding client requests to the target servers. It acts as an intermediary on behalf of the client, effectively "proxying" the client's requests to external services or websites.

# Forward Proxy Workflow:

1. Client Request:
   The client sends a request to the forward proxy for a resource (e.g., a webpage).
2. Forward Proxy Processing:
   The forward proxy processes the request, applies rules (e.g., filtering, caching), and forwards the request to the target server.
3. Server Response:
   The target server sends the response to the forward proxy.
4. Forward Proxy to Client:
   The proxy sends the response back to the client.

# Why we need forward proxy?

1. Client-Side Proxy:
   A forward proxy works on behalf of the client. It forwards client requests to the destination server and passes the response back to the client.
   The client is aware of the forward proxy, but the destination server only sees requests coming from the proxy, not the actual client.

2. Anonymity:
   The forward proxy can hide the identity (IP address) of the client from the destination server, providing a layer of anonymity.

3. Content Filtering:
   Organizations or networks often use forward proxies to restrict access to certain websites or services by filtering content based on predefined rules.

4. Caching:
   Forward proxies can cache frequently requested content. This reduces bandwidth usage and speeds up access to resources that are requested repeatedly by multiple clients.

5. Access Control:
   Proxies can enforce rules regarding who can access certain external resources, controlling what internal clients are allowed to access.

6. Network Protection:
   In some cases, forward proxies are used to add a layer of protection between clients and external networks, reducing the exposure of internal systems.
