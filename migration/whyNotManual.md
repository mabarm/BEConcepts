# Using SQL and Migrations: Pros and Cons

## Advantages of Using Direct SQL

- **Full Control:** Direct SQL gives you complete control over exactly what happens in the database.
- **Simple Changes:** If you're making small or one-time changes, SQL can be quick and easy.
- **Direct Execution:** You can use any SQL client or tool to make the changes right away.

## Drawbacks of Using Only SQL

While using SQL works fine for quick changes, there are some challenges:

- **No Versioning:** If you're managing a project over time, direct SQL changes don't provide a record of what was changed and when. This makes it hard to track changes or roll them back if something goes wrong.
- **Harder to Share:** If you’re working with a team or need to deploy the changes to different environments (like production, testing, etc.), it’s harder to ensure everyone is on the same page. You'll have to share SQL scripts manually and make sure they're applied in the right order.
- **Rollback is Tricky:** If you make a mistake in your SQL, rolling back (reverting) changes can be tricky, especially if you don't have proper backups or rollback scripts.
- **More Prone to Errors:** Writing complex SQL (especially for larger changes) manually increases the risk of mistakes, which could corrupt data or break functionality.

## How Migrations Help

Migration tools (like golang-migrate, Goose, or ORM's AutoMigrate) essentially generate and organize SQL scripts for you. The advantages of using migrations over manual SQL include:

- **Version Control:** Each migration is tracked and numbered, so you always know the order of changes.
- **Consistent Environments:** You can apply the same changes across multiple environments (local, staging, production) without worrying about forgetting a step.
- **Rollback Support:** Migrations often include built-in rollback functionality, so if something goes wrong, you can easily undo the last change.

## Example Comparison

**With SQL:**

- You write a script: `ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN profile_picture;`
- You run it directly in the database.
- If you need to share it with your team, you send them the SQL script manually, and they need to remember to apply it.
- If you want to undo it, you’ll have to write another SQL command like `ALTER TABLE users DROP COLUMN profile_picture;`.

**With Migrations:**

- You create a migration with the command: `migrate create add_profile_picture_to_users`
- The migration tool generates the SQL for you and tracks it.
- You run `migrate up` to apply the migration across all environments.
- If you need to undo the change, you can run `migrate down`, and it automatically rolls back the changes.

## Conclusion

Yes, you can directly add or alter your database using SQL, and for small, simple changes, that might be enough. But as your project grows or if you're working with a team, a migration system becomes very useful to keep everything organized, consistent, and easy to track. It reduces the risk of manual mistakes and gives you version control over your database changes.

If you're working on something small and simple, feel free to go ahead with SQL. But for more complex projects, especially with teams, migrations will save you headaches down the road!
