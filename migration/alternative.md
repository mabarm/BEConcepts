If you prefer not to use AutoMigrate or need more control over your database schema migrations, there are several alternative approaches and tools you can use in Go:

## 1. Manual SQL Migrations

In this approach, you manually write SQL migration scripts to handle database schema changes. This gives you full control over the schema and makes migrations explicit and predictable.
You can:
Write SQL scripts (up.sql and down.sql) for migrating forward and backward.
Run the scripts directly using Go's database/sql package or use a dedicated migration tool.
Example of manually executing SQL:
go
Copy code
db.Exec("CREATE TABLE users (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY, name VARCHAR(100), age INT);")

2. Migration Libraries
   Various migration libraries provide more robust migration management and are used to create, apply, and track schema changes. These tools offer more control over how and when migrations are applied, along with version tracking and rollbacks.
   Here are some popular alternatives:

# 2.1. golang-migrate

golang-migrate is a popular migration library for Go. It supports writing migrations in both raw SQL and Go, and it can target multiple databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQLite).

# 2.2. Goose

Goose is another migration tool for Go. Like golang-migrate, it supports both SQL and Go-based migrations and provides a CLI tool for managing migrations.

# 2.3. SQLBoiler

SQLBoiler is an ORM but with a different approach than GORM. It focuses on generating Go code from an existing database schema, which makes it an alternative to automatic migrations by expecting the schema to be defined first, usually via raw SQL or migration tools.

## 3. Migration Tools + ORM

Many developers prefer using an ORM (like GORM or SQLBoiler) in combination with a migration tool like golang-migrate or Goose. This gives you the flexibility of having structured data models in Go, with the control of versioned migrations.

## 4. Manual Schema Management + database/sql

If you prefer complete control without using an ORM, you can manually manage database operations using Go's database/sql package. This approach is more work but gives full control over query optimization, SQL structure, and performance.
