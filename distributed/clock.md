## In distributed systems, clock synchronization is indeed a critical issue because each machine has its own local clock, and these clocks can drift due to hardware imperfections, leading to inconsistencies in time between different machines.

- This is problematic for coordination, consistency, and correctness in distributed operations.

# Key Concepts:

- **Clock Drift**:
  Every clock in a distributed system may tick at slightly different rates due to variations in hardware. Clock drift refers to the divergence of a clock's time from the actual, real-world time. Over time, even a small drift can result in significant discrepancies between the clocks on different machines.

- **Clock Skew**:
  Clock skew is the difference in time between clocks on two different machines at any given point. It is the observable effect of clock drift.

- **Synchronized Time**:
  Distributed systems often require that clocks are synchronized across machines to avoid issues with event ordering, consistency, and coordination.
  Perfect synchronization is impossible due to factors like network latency, but minimizing differences between clocks is a practical goal.

# Why Clock Synchronization Matters:

- 1. Ordering Events: Many algorithms rely on the assumption that events are properly ordered in time (e.g., in databases or distributed logs). Without synchronized clocks, a system might misinterpret the order of events.
- 2. Timestamps for Coordination: In systems like distributed databases, timestamps may be used to ensure consistency between replicated data, as in Lamport Timestamps, which use logical clocks to establish event ordering.
- 3. Distributed Transactions: Many distributed algorithms, such as consensus algorithms (like Paxos, Raft) or distributed locking mechanisms (like Googleâ€™s Chubby), rely on consistent global time for coordination.
- 4. Causality Tracking: Maintaining causality between events in a distributed system becomes difficult without synchronized clocks.
